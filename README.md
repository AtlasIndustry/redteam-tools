# Red Team Tools

Quick scripts to support offensive security workflows.

## Scripts

- **parse_tokens.py**  
  Extracts Bearer tokens from Evilginx2 logs for easy copy/use.

- **mythic_launcher.sh**  
  Starts Mythic and lists available payloads after a short delay.

- **wifi_crack_helper.sh**  
  Automates WPA2 handshake cracking using aircrack-ng + rockyou.

More to come as I build and refine internal tooling.
